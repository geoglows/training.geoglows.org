# What is GEOGLOWS?

## Overview

The GEOGLOWS (Global Earth Observations Global Water Sustainability) initiative is a collaborative effort aimed at improving global water
sustainability through advanced hydrological forecasting and data analysis. Leveraging the power of Earth observations, numerical weather predictions,
and supercomputing, GEOGLOWS provides actionable information through our hydrologic model, the River Forecast System (RFS). RFS provides streamflow
time series data for over 6 million river segments worldwide. By making decades of historical climatological flow data and future forecasts easily
accessible, RFS supports informed decision-making in water resource management, disaster risk reduction, and climate adaptation. This global service
enables countries and organizations to enhance their understanding of water-related challenges and implement effective solutions, ultimately
contributing to a more sustainable and resilient future.

## History

The GEOGLOWS initiative, established under the framework of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO), has its roots in a commitment to integrate Earth
observation data to enhance global water sustainability. The journey began in 2014 at the GEO Plenary in Geneva, where the need for coordinated water
data management became evident. With support from partners such as NASA, ECMWF, and regional organizations, GEOGLOWS evolved from early efforts in the
Dominican Republic to a broader application of global hydrological modeling. By leveraging advanced technologies, including the ECMWFâ€™s global weather
forecasts and cutting-edge cloud computing, GEOGLOWS pioneered global streamflow forecasting services in the creation of the model that is now known
as RFS. These services provide critical information to support decision-making in water management, helping to mitigate the impacts of floods,
droughts, and other water-related challenges. Over time, the initiative has expanded its reach, integrating local and regional hydrological insights,
and fostering collaborations across continents to address the complex issues of water scarcity and disaster preparedness.

## Model Formulation

The GEOGLOWS model leverages the Hydrology Tiled ECMWF Scheme for Surface Exchanges over Land (HTESSEL) and the ECMWF Integrated Forecast System (IFS)
to as the runoff data input for the hydrologic streamflow model. HTESSEL simulates how land surfaces respond to atmospheric conditions, estimating
critical variables such as surface and sub-surface runoff for both operational ensemble forecasts and retrospective simulations. We intersect grid
lines with specific basins of RFS and apply runoff depth values, to calculate water volumes over different time periods. These are routed through the
stream network using the Muskingum method with the RAPID algorithm. We report the discharge values at each of the stream segments. For more
information on the model itself, please see the publication page where there are links to the academic publications explaining the model

## River Forecast System Training

To learn more about our model, RFS, continue with our training under the River Forecast System portion of this website. This training is broken down
into 3 main sections, each having different sub sections within them. We recommend you start with the first section (Available Data) before
progressing to the second section (Accessing Data). The third section (Skills and Examples) is a more advanced section designed for people looking to
complete specific tasks using the RFS data who already have a good understanding of the first two sections. As you are learning about the data, there
is also a website available with more information on how to download and use the RFS data: https://data.geoglows.org/. This is a great resource once
you have a basic understanding of the data. Here is a brief overview of what you can expect to learn:

1. **Available Data** - This section details the available datasets from RFS. It is divided into 3 sections:
    - **a. GIS Data** - This section explains the hydrography data used in the RFS, including stream centerlines, catchment boundaries, and their
      unique identifiers, derived from high-resolution elevation products.
    - **b. Retrospective River Discharge** - In this section, we describe over 85 years of daily average streamflow data, derived from meteorological
      reanalysis and updated weekly.
    - **c. Forecast River Discharge** - This section explains out daily streamflow forecasts with 51 ensembles providing predictions at 3-hour
      intervals.

2. **Accessing Data** - This section explains how the previously described data can be accessed and downloaded using 4 different techniques. Each
   section will detail a different technique:
    - **a. A Data Catalog** - This section explains the data catalog available through AWS buckets.
    - **b. A Data Service** - This section describes how to use our REST API to access GEOGLOWS data.
    - **c. A Web Map** - This section explains the Esri Living Atlas map layer that can be loaded into any GIS software (ArcGIS or QGIS).
    - **d. A Web App** - This section introduces you to the HydroViewer, which is our web application that allows for easy visualization and download
      of data globally.

3. **Skills and Examples** - This section explains more advanced techniques that can be used when using the data for specific purposes.
    - **a. Accessing and Interpreting Data** - This section includes Google Colab notebooks that show you how to use the GEOGLOWS Python package to
      make and customize your streamflow plots.
    - **b. Bias Correction and SABER Overview** - This section gives a brief overview of bias correction and a technique called SABER that applies
      bias correction to other areas.
    - **c. Bias Correction for Forecast Data** - This section provides a notebook that goes through examples of bias-correcting the forecast data.

## Stories of Application

GEOGLOWS has been instrumental in transforming water management and disaster response across the globe. From helping predict floods and droughts in
Nepal, to improving transboundary flow forecasts in Bangladesh, GEOGLOWS empowers local agencies with the tools to make life-saving decisions. In the
Dominican Republic, GEOGLOWS enhances capacity for hydrological challenges, including flood risk and irrigation management. The service has extended
early warning lead times in Malawi and has been crucial in managing reservoir releases during hurricanes in Honduras. These real-world applications
demonstrate the global impact of GEOGLOWS in addressing critical water-related challenges. For more in-depth stories of how GEOGLOWS is making a
