## Return periods, flow duration curves, and average flows

To further explore the analysis of return periods, flow duration curves, and seasonal averages, we invite you to follow along with our interactive
demonstration in the provided Google Colab notebook. This hands-on notebook will guide you through the process, using real data from the Tensift River
in Morocco. You can access and run the notebook directly in your browser:

### Retrospective Data

To dive deeper into the analysis of retrospective data, return periods, flow duration curves, and seasonal averages, we have prepared an interactive
Google Colab notebook. This notebook provides step-by-step guidance for conducting these analyses using real-world data from the San Juan River at
Rancho La Trinidad in Costa Rica. It covers both retrospective data and statistical flow analysis, allowing you to engage with the data and methods
discussed in this guide: [Retrospective Simulation Colab.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1P3yNvE1EoQ9U8emCsMkm18CSpKWahvc5?usp=sharing)

## Forecast Simulation

The Colab notebook provides an interactive guide on accessing and visualizing forecast data from the GEOGLOWS Model. It demonstrates how to retrieve
streamflow forecasts, plot the data using Python libraries, and interpret key statistics for effective water resource management and
planning: [Forecast Simulation Colab.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1C2-zkxGC7U280U2CRkSK2TbQD1nr2H1T?usp=drive_link)
